Exercise 1
a - I think this is an example of linear time complexity (O(n)). While you're doing a lot of math, you're not doing anything n-times.
b -  This is an example of logarithmic, O(log n). I think this is the case because with each iteration, the data set becomes smaller by half.
c - I think this algorithm is quadradic, O(n^2). This time complexity is common with nested loops.
d - 
e - 
f -  bunnyEars is linear time complexity, O(n).
