Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?

o(n) because we are applying cb to every value once as we traverse the list, appending value to stack and then 

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?

 O(n)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

O(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

O(n)

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?

O(nlog(n)) --  heapsort has an O(n) time complexity and class Heap a logarithmic time complexity

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array? 

O(n)

If we altered the input array we would a constant complexity 

O(1)  auxiliary space
