Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
    runtime complexity is O(n)

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
    space complexity is also O(n)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
    runtime complexity is O(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
    space complexity is also O(n)

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
    heapsort is log linear or O(n log(n))

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
    Altering the input arr would be O(1) since it's the same array
